Maybe IE would let you do it.\n- In the *settings.json* file you will find some settings like the data on the 'About' area, blog name and how many posts mkdumblog should load on the home page.\n- There's also the default favicon, which you can change.\n- Included in [YourUsername.github.io/?page=editor](?page=editor) (magic link, click on it!) is the editor page called mkCanvas, which runs with the *SimpleMDE* markdown editor.\n- To publish on GitHub Pages you just need to commit to your .github.io repo the files generated in the */dist* folder after you run **npm install** and then **npm run build** on your console. (There's also pre-compiled versions available on the [ngx-mkdumblog repo](http://github.com/pedroCX486/ngx-mkdumblog).)\n- If you use the pre-compiled version, you don't need to (re)build anything. Just modify the *settings.json* and publish it! The pre-compiled version is generated using **npm run build** and compressed using 7-zip.\n\nAnd I guess that's it! Happy blogging!",
